Using React on the frontend and a custom Rails API on the backend, users can browse and search items, update their cart, checkout, and view past orders. Additional libraries and middleware used in this project include Redux, Thunk, Google OAuth, and the Stripe API. Also, I had a lot of fun discovering reusable components and styling this project with Material UI.',

        description: 'As a music teacher, I enjoy having students make connections between music and storytelling. With that in mind, I built Musical Musings so that users could create playlists and share stories all in one place. I deployed this app using Heroku and have since used it in the classroom with my students, and it has been awesome getting to see what they create! Using the Spotify API, users can search and add songs from within the app. In addition, users are able to craft stories, add images, and listen to other playlists.  Other features and libraries include Google OAuth, bcrypt, Bootstrap, and CanCanCan, a really cool gem to help with route authorizations.',

Also, users can add notes about their experience for future reference. This project was styled using Bootstrap. Yay beer!',
