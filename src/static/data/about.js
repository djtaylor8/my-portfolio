    bio: "Welcome! My name is DJ Taylor. No, I’m not a DJ - I’m a full stack developer, and a classically trained musician. I’ve played trombone in cities all over the world, including Shanghai, Mexico City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. I love seeking out new opportunities to play, whether it’s in a Balkan Brass band or providing music for a Shakespeare show in a bar. I’ve been a music educator for about a decade as well, working both as a private instructor and classroom teacher. On the side, I enjoy nerding out about coffee and wine, playing in a pinball league, hiking, camping, traveling, and doing yoga.", 
    dev: "So why did I become a developer? As a music teacher trying to make things work for Zoom classes in 2020, I started looking for different kinds of activities to do with my students. I stumbled upon a platform called Earsketch, which is a DAW (similar to Garageband) that teaches both musical concepts and coding in JavaScript and Python. I started poking around and was instantly hooked after my first ‘Hello World’. Something clicked. I immediately began taking in everything I could related to coding and other computer science topics and have not looked back since. To further develop my skills, I enrolled in the Flatiron School Software Engineering program, built up a portfolio of projects, and connected with some really awesome people. I'm passionate about flexing my creative problem solving skills and taking on new challenges as I work to build web applications that are a joy to use. I’m taking a leap into a new career path, but I’m confident that my experiences, education, and values have all prepared me to be successful as a full stack developer.", 
    end: "I’m excited to be part of a team that is passionate about making a difference with the work we do. I look forward to building meaningful relationships as I continue this exciting new journey one step at a time."
