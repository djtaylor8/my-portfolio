    bio: "Welcome! My name is DJ Taylor. No, I’m not a DJ- I’m a full stack developer, and a classically trained musician. I’ve played trombone in venues from Shanghai to Mexico City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. I always love seeking out new opportunities to play, whether it’s in a Balkan Brass band, or providing music for a Shakespeare show in a bar. I’ve also been a music educator for about ten years, working both as a private instructor and classroom teacher. Being a teacher also means learning a bunch of new instruments, and that has been a blast- yes, even the recorder can be fun. On the side, I also enjoy nerding out about coffee and wine, playing in a pinball league, hiking, camping, traveling, and yoga.", 
    dev: "So why did I become a developer? As a music teacher trying to make things work for Zoom classes in 2020, I started looking for different kinds of activities to do with my students. I stumbled upon a platform called Earsketch, which is a DAW (similar to Garageband) that teaches both musical concepts and coding in JavaScript and Python. I started poking around and was immediately hooked after my first ‘Hello World’. Something clicked. I took in a lot of the resources available online related to coding and other computer science topics and have not looked back since. I enrolled in the Flatiron School Software Engineering program, built up a portfolio of projects, and connected with some really awesome people. I absolutely love working on new projects and building beautiful web applications. Getting to flex my problem solving skills, creativity, and most importantly, absorbing all of the learning that takes place along the way are things I’m passionate about, and I’m eager to continue on this path. I’m taking a leap into an entirely new career, but I’m also bringing my experiences, education, and values with me. I’m confident these have all prepared me to have a positive impact in a variety of different settings. ", 
    end: "I’m excited to be part of a team passionate about making a difference with our work, building meaningful relationships, and continuing this exciting new journey one step at a time. Reach out if you’d like to connect. I look forward to hearing from you!"
