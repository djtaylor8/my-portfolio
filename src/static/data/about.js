    bio: "Hey there! My name is DJ Taylor, and I’m glad you’re here. You might be thinking to yourself, wait a minute, is this guy actually a DJ? The answer to that unfortunately is no, not yet. But don’t worry, I get that all the time. So what do I do? Well I am a musician, so not that far off, but my primary instrument is the trombone. I’ve played in venues all over, from Shanghai to Mexico City, to random bars in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Whether it’s a full orchestra, jazz band, Balkan Brass band, or providing tunes for a barely rehearsed Shakespeare show in a bar, I’ve done a lot and always love seeking out new opportunities to play. I’ve also been a music educator for about ten years, working both as a private instructor and classroom teacher in several different schools. Being a teacher also means learning a bunch of new instruments, and that has been a blast. I’ve picked up a lot over the years, including the violin, drums, guitar, all the woodwinds, brass, and yes, even the recorder. Outside of that, I am really into my hobbies. I like to get into a lot of things, including nerding out about coffee and wine, playing in pinball leagues, hiking, camping, going on adventures, exploring new places, playing sports, doing yoga, and meditating. I’m always excited to push my boundaries, and I like to mix it up by learning and experiencing new things all the time.", 
    dev: "So why did I choose to become a developer? In the very early days of the pandemic as a music teacher trying to make things work for Zoom classes, I started looking for different kinds of activities to do with my students. One day I stumbled upon a platform called Earsketch, which is a DAW (similar to Garageband) that teaches both musical concepts and coding in JavaScript and Python. I started poking around and was immediately hooked after my first ‘Hello World’. I followed my curiosity and started taking in a lot of the resources available online related to coding and other computer science topics and have not looked back since. I enrolled in the Flatiron School Full Stack Developer and Software Engineering program, built up a portfolio of projects, and connected with some really awesome people. I absolutely love working on new projects and building beautiful web applications. Getting to flex my problem solving skills, creativity, and most importantly, all of the learning that takes place along the way are all things I’m passionate about, and I’m eager to continue on this path. I’m taking a leap into an entirely new career, but I’m also bringing my experiences, education, and values with me, and I’m confident these have all prepared me to have a positive impact in a variety of settings. I’m ready to be part of a team passionate about making a difference with our work, building meaningful relationships, and continuing this exciting new journey one step at a time.",
